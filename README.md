# Final-Project-Intro-to-Machine-Learning
This project is a group effort by myself, Brian Morton, Meghan Conway, and Katie Quinn. The original group repository is [here](https://github.com/mconwa20/Final-project.git). We ran into some issues with Github data allotment & Git LFS allowing further pushes, so files have been re-uploaded here.
